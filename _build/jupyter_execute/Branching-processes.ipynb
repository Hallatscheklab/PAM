    "What are general patterns we might expect when a population grows out of a single cell?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most basic question is to characterize how a population grows over time. Deterministically, we expect exponential growth if prolifertion at rate $a$ exceeds the rate $b$ of death. In many cases, both quantities are similar, for example in an epidemic situation where $R_0$ is about 1, or for a slightly beneficial mutaiton in a population going through generations. In these near critical cases, it is not obvious whether a population survives rather than goes extinct by chance and, if it survives, what population size distribution on might expect. \n",

    "$$  (br-process-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the first term on the right hand side simply says that, conditional on no death or birth event occurs within the time span $\\epsilon$, the probability of survival remains unchanged.\n",
